# ETAAcademy-ZKRs-Bridges

This GitHub repository aims to improve the security of ZKRs(Zero-Knowledge Rollups) and cross-chain bridge by:

- Researches on the characteristics of existing bridges, including verification methods, communication models, and functionalities.
- Identifying potential attack vectors that attackers may exploit.
- Analyzing reported cross-chain bridge attacks and categorizing them into distinct vulnerabilities.
- Code projects for ZKRs and bridge developers to build more secure systems.
